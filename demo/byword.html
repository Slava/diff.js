This part of the
document has stayed the
same from version to
version.  It shouldn't
be shown if it doesn't
change.  Otherwise, that
would not be helping to
compress the size of the
changes.

This paragraph contains
text that is outdated.
It will be deleted in the
near future.

It is important to spell
check this dokument. On
the other hand, a
misspelled word isn't
the end of the world.
Nothing in the rest of
this paragraph needs to
be changed. Things can
be added after it.
